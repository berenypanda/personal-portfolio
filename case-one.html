            <h2>Description</h2>
            <h3>Details</h3>
            <p>A semester-long team project for my Internet Marketing class.</p>
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <ul class="case">
              <li>To apply Internet Marketing concepts to build a simple website for a hairstylist (Alexus Hair Designs.) </li>
              <li>To create PHP supported interactive features that would support the business needs of Alexus Hair Designs. 
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Journey</h2>
            <h3>Choosing a Client</h3>
            <p>Our client was my team member’s hairstylist, Alexus. Alexus is a traveling hairstylist that performs services at clients’ homes. My partner personally knowing the client gave us a better idea of the user journey that the website should support. </p>
            <h3>Analyzing The Client</h3>
            <ul class="case">
              <li>We created a business model of Alexus Hair Designs and conducted a SWOT Analysis to determine what features to place on the website. 
                <ul class="case">
                  <li>Alexus’s value proposition, or main benefit to prospective clients, is the convenience of using a hairstylist in the comfort of one’s own home.</li>
                  <li>The convenience gives Alexus a competitive advantage, but customers may turn to salons for familiarity and lower prices in sacrifice of convenience. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Observing competitors reminded us to have transparent pricing and to use images to advertise to our known demographic (mainly 25-60 year old women.)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Designing and Building</h3>
            <ul class="case">
              <li>My partner translated the brand image and selling points into parts of our design.
                <ul class="case">
                  <li>Color Palette and Typography</li>
                    <ul class="case">
                      <li>Soft neutral colors and sans serif fonts helped create a sleek, professional and relaxing overall feel to the website.</li>
                    </ul>
                  <li>Call To Action and Hero Image</li>
                  <ul class="case">
                    <li>Soft neutral colors and sans serif fonts helped create a sleek, professional and relaxing overall feel to the website.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>I focused on building the two main interactive features using PHP.</li>
                <ul class="case">
                  <li>Booking Appointment Form
                    <ul class="case">
                      <li>This form supports the main call to action. It also generates a basic confirmation email using the PHP mail() function. I had an interest in creating a stylized confirmation email, but this proved too complex for me at the time.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>      
                  <li>Promo Code
                    <ul class="case">
                      <li>Soft neutral colors and sans serif fonts helped create a sleek, professional and relaxing overall feel to the website.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <ul class="case">
              <li>Viewing changes in real time became tedious with the UTA Cloud hosting service. I’d have to reupload my file each time just to see tiny changes I made in the CSS, for example.
                <ul class="case">
                  <li>I solved this problem by discovering MAMP, a tool that allows me to run a server locally to play around with dynamic websites. This allowed me to view changes in real time, speeding up my development process. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>While I was experienced in using git version control as an individual, using it with another person became challenging.
                <ul class="case">
                  <li> We decided to split our work beforehand each day, with me sending files at the end of the day. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="case-conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <h3>What I'd Do Differently</h3>
            <ul class="case">
              <li>Utilizing more real images from the client, especially those of high quality. 
              </li>
              <li>Utilize git as a team instead of sending files asynchronously. I learned that through GitHub desktop and VSCode, there are ways to commit and push changes without everyone having to learn bash language. 
              </li>
              <li>Place the main call to action on several pages. I noticed that it is only on one page, which forces the user to return to the homepage. Ideally, users should be able to explore services, or learn about the client, then be reminded with a nearby button on the same page to perform the main objective (booking an appointment.)</li>
